                                    Here is where interesting thing start to happen.
                                    
                                    Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
                                    of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
                                    the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
                                    
                                    Positioning information is passed through data attributes.
                                    
                                    In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
                                    and `data-y="-1500` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
                                    will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'.
                                    
                                    It will not be rotated or scaled.
                                    
                                -->
                                <div id="bored" class="step slide" data-x="-1000" data-y="-1500">
                                    <q>Aren't you just <b>bored</b> with all those slides-based presentations?</q>

                                <!--
                                    
                                    The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
                                    If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.
                                    
                                    So in the example below it'll be `step-2`.
                                    
                                    The hash part of the url when this step is active will be `#/step-2`.
                                    
                                    You can also use `#step-2` in a link, to point directly to this particular step.
                                    
                                    Please note, that while `#/step-2` (with slash) would also work in a link it's not recommended.
                                    Using classic `id`-based links like `#step-2` makes these links usable also in fallback mode.
                                    
                                -->

                                    This is an example of step element being scaled.
                                    
                                    Again, we use a `data-` attribute, this time it's `data-scale="4"`, so it means that this
                                    element will be 4 times larger than the others.
                                    From presentation and transitions point of view it means, that it will have to be scaled
                                    down (4 times) to make it back to it's correct size.

                                    Notation shouldn't be a surprise. We use `data-rotate="90"` attribute, meaning that this
                                    element should be rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.

                                    And now it gets really exiting! We move into third dimension!
                                    
                                    Along with `data-x` and `data-y`, you can define the position on third (Z) axis, with
                                    `data-z`. In the example below we use `data-z="-3000"` meaning that element should be
                                    positioned far away from us (by 3000px).

                                    You can not only position element in 3D, but also rotate it around any axis.
                                    So this one here will get rotated by -40 degrees (40 degrees anticlockwise) around X axis and
                                    10 degrees (clockwise) around Y axis.
                                    
                                    You can of course rotate it around Z axis with `data-rotate-z` - it has exactly the same effect
                                    as `data-rotate` (these two are basically aliases).
