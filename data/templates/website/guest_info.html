    <h3>The Wedding</h3>
    We are having the wedding outdoors at the Lakewood Fireman's Lodge. There is an indoor area in case of weather, but we hope that it will be a rustic and informal event. The ceremony will be around dusk, with the reception to follow, so we also suggest a lightweight sweater or jacket. Check back for more details!
    <h3>If You're Flying</h3>
    The closest airport is in Jamestown, New York, but it is usually cheaper to fly into Buffalo and then drive to Jamestown. If you would like to share a rental car with someone, just leave a note in the guest book and check for others who are looking to share as well.  
    <h3>Hotels</h3>
    We have a group-rate at the Comfort Inn (2800 North Main St. Jamestown 716-664-5920 and ask for the Warner-Hazzard Wedding Rate). There are also a few other hotels available nearby, including the Hampton Inn (4 West Oak Hill Road) and a Best Western Plus in Downtown Jamestown. If you want a luxureous experience, there is also a B&B called The Oaks (1103 West 3rd Street).
