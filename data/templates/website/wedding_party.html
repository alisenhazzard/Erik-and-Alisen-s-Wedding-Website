        <h3 class='wedding_party_title'>Haley, Maid of Honor</h3>
        Haley and I have been best friends since 7th grade, and she's wonderful! She is a great friend, even when we were continents apart during college. She is super-cool: she can knit the most beautiful scarves and hats, she loves artsy things, and she makes the very best apple pie ever! We’ve kept in touch through college, and now Haley lives in Pensacola, Florida with her sweetie, Matt. I couldn’t imagine my big day without her, and I'm so excited to have her as my MOH!

        <h3 class='wedding_party_title'>Karissa, Bridesmaid</h3>
       Karissa is Erik’s younger sister, and she and I were roommates in my last year of college. Her style is the cutest, and she always has great ideas for clothes, and hair, and makeup, and shoes, and everything! Plus, her cooking is restaurant-quality, and comfort food that makes you feel at home. She is going to start law school in the fall, and one day we will get to call her Judge Hazzard (how cool is that?!) Thank you so much for your help, and for being a great (future) sister-in-law.

        <h3 class='wedding_party_title'>Carolyn, Bridesmaid</h3>
        Carolyn is engaged to my younger brother, Brett! She has such a big heart, so don't let her see a sad puppy, or it will find a new home :) She is a great friend, and she is so good and sweet to my brother. Carolyn is graduating in April from the University of Floirda, and I'm so happy that she will be a member of our wedding party, and that soon she will be my sister. I can't wait to call you a Warner!

        Aleksi and I have been friends since high school, and she was such a fabulous friend to have growing up. She made me feel like I was part of her family, and I will always remember the trips to Disney World and the Keys as some of my favorite vacations. Aleksi has the best sense of humor, the cutest hairstyles, and the most creative ideas for fashion and trends. She is currently working on her masters of social work at the Univerisity of Utah and lives in a precious little home in Provo. I can't wait to celebrate with her!

        Chris is Erik's best friend, and they met in high school in Brandon, Florida. Sometimes I think they share a brain, because they are always thinkning the same thing! He's a talented web developer and programmer, and says that Erik taught him everything he knows about programming. He loves playing video games with Erik until the wee hours of the night, enjoys a good Guiness, and is always the life of the party. He is currently coming to the wedding stag, so ladies, get ready for a fun night!

        When Erik and I lived in Tallahassee, we did our laundry in the apartment laundry room. One night, Erik left to do laundry, and was gone for an hour (which was 55 minutes longer than usual), soI walked to the laundry room to find Erik and Derek, who had just met and were already talking like they've know each other forever. They have been friends since that fateful night, and Derek now lives in Indiana where he is studying and one day hopes to own a coffee shop.

        The Warners have always been close, and it's been so different with us living all over the country. I'm so glad that Mom and Dad have found a niche in New York, and Brett, I can't wait to see where you end up after college. I know you'll be great, no matter where you are, especially with a wonderful woman by your side. Mom and Dad, thank you for everything you're doing to prepare for the wedding (watch out, or Mom will be the next Wedding Planner in Jamestown!) You have been such great role models, and I hope our marriage can be as happy as yours.
        <br /><br />Love you,
        <br />Ali

        The Hazzards lived across the country before settling down in Florida.  We're a tight knit family and even though we've lived apart from each other for the past years we've always managed to stay close.  I'm thrilled for Karissa and her goal to become the best (and most fit) judge ever.  It's been awesome growing closer to you and I always enjoy your company and talking with you.  To Mom and Dad, it's been hard to talk with the time difference but I'm always thinking of you guys.  I can't thank you enough for everything you've done; if I've achieved anything it's because of your support and guidance (even if I don't always show it).  I hope to have as good of a marriage as you, and to try to follow the great examples you've set for me.
        <br /><br />Love you,
        <br />Erik
